        Finance management is the strategic planning and managing of an
        individual or organizationâ€™s finances to better align their financial
        status to their goals and objectives. Depending on the size of a
        company, finance management seeks to optimize shareholder value,
        generate profit, mitigate risk, and safeguard the company's financial
        health in the short and long term. When working with individuals,
        finance management may entail planning for retirement, college savings,
        and other personal investments.
